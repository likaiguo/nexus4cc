## What is Nexus4CC?

Nexus4CC turns any browser into a command center for **Claude Code** — and works with Codex, Gemini CLI, or any terminal-based AI agent. It bridges directly to tmux sessions running on your machine, so you can monitor, switch between, and command your agents from anywhere.

Phone, tablet, foldable, or desktop — one interface, every device. No cloud. No subscription. No SSH gymnastics. Just your terminal, everywhere.

---

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔌 **WebSocket ↔ tmux bridge** | One PTY per window. Real-time bidirectional I/O. Close your browser — your agents keep running. |
| 📱 **Any-screen terminal** | xterm.js with swipe navigation, pinch-to-zoom, and a configurable soft toolbar. Touch-friendly on mobile, full keyboard on desktop — one interface that adapts. |
| 📂 **Embedded file browser** | Browse, edit, and preview Markdown files in a resizable sidebar. Sort by name, date, or size. |
| 🗂️ **Project & channel management** | Directory-based projects with Slack-like channel sessions. Switch contexts instantly — like workspaces for your terminal. |
| 💾 **Session persistence** | tmux-resurrect keeps your sessions alive across reboots. Pick up exactly where you left off. |
| 🔀 **Multi-session** | Run multiple tmux sessions in parallel. Switch between them without leaving the browser. |
| 🎨 **PWA** | Installable on iOS and Android. Dark and light themes. Feels like a native app, works offline. |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librae8226/nexus4cc.git && cd nexus4cc
cp .env.example .env          # set JWT_SECRET, WORKSPACE_ROOT
npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
npm start
# Open http://localhost:59000 on any device 🚀
```

> 💡 **For human users:** follow the Quick Start above. The instructions below are for AI assistants helping with installation.

### For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant helping a user install Nexus:

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `node scripts/setup.js` — handles deps, frontend build, PM2, and first tmux session
3. Verify: `pm2 status` shows `nexus` online → open `http://localhost:59000`

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, tmux. PM2 is installed automatically if missing.  
Default login password: `nexus123`. While the default is active, the login page pre-fills it and lets you show or hide it with the eye button; after login, change it in Settings → Security. Once a custom password is set, the login page no longer displays the default password.

---

## Deployment

Expose securely without port forwarding via [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) or [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).

---

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 20+ | |
| tmux | any recent | |
| PM2 | any recent | auto-installed by `setup.js` |
| OS | Linux / WSL2 | |

---

## Security

Nexus is a **single-user, self-hosted tool** — not a multi-tenant platform.

- 🔒 bcrypt (12 rounds) password hash + JWT (30d)
- ⚠️ WebSocket token passed via query string — enable TLS in production
- 🛡️ Run behind firewall, VPN, or tunnel — do not expose directly to the internet

## Author

Nexus4CC was built by [Librae](https://github.com/librae8226) — software engineer, entrepreneur, and early-stage VC investor.

The best ideas never come at your desk. Nexus4CC was born from a real need: commanding AI agents on the go — from airports, taxis, and between meetings. Now it's open source, and it's yours.
